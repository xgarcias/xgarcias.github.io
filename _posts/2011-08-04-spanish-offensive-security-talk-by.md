The following video corresponds to a talk presented by [Roberto Martinez](http://twitter.com/r0bertmart1nez) at the [Campus Party in Mexico](http://www.campus-party.com.mx/2011/index.html)

I high ly recommend watching this video since it explains as security in real life should be, instead of installing devices and ticking a checkbox :)

I would resume the talk as:

* Information gathering
* Intelligence
* Honeypots
* Feed all your information in a SIEM system to monitor the network activity.
* Deception and counter attacks: resource exhaustion, dropping exploits
* Deanonimation and tracking at tackers:Â  [decloaking](http://decloak.net/%20) and using our DNS to track the attacker.

In my opinion, I would also add [Darknets or sinkholes](http://www.infosectoday.com/Articles/Darknets.htm) to gain more extra intelligence :)
