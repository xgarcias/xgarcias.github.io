Many Europeans are familiars with laws tailored against our privacy. Here is common that any ISP or phone provider has to keep all their data three years in case the state needs it for a prosecution. Furthermore, more and more news confirm that many states are using state financed trojans to spy on their citizens.

Last week [PRISM](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/09/technology-giants-nsa-prism-surveillance) hit the news with a bit scandal . **The big American service providers cooperating with the NSA to spy on their citizens**!.Â  Of course this reminds me the [Chaos Communication Congress](http://events.ccc.de/congress/) that took place in Berlin in 2008, with the motto [Nothing to Hide](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/wiki/Main_Page/).

If you are a good buddy, why trying to protect your privacy? You haven't done anything wrong, do you? :)

Here is the link to the 25c3 [keynote](http://ftp.ccc.de/congress/25c3/video_h264_720x576/25c3-3025-en-opening_and_keynote_nothing_to_hide.mp4).
