This great [article](https://blogs.sans.org/computer-forensics/2010/10/06/images-dmcrypt-lvm2/) from [Sans Computer Forensics](https://blogs.sans.org/computer-forensics/)Â  shows how to perform forensics investigations in a disk image that contains [LUKS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LUKS) volumes.  
  
The following tricks appear in the article:  

*   Use **losetup** to create a read-only logical device pointing to the LUKS partition.
*   Use **cryptsetup** to verify that the partitions is LUKS and then mount it.
*   LVM2 Fu to load/unload the Volum Groups
