Nice [article](http://www.backtrack-linux.org/wiki/index.php/DECT_Sniffing_Dedected) in the [BackTrack Wiki](http://www.backtrack-linux.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) that explains how to sniff phone calls made with [DECT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Enhanced_Cordless_Telecommunications) devices.

The text explains how to  install  and run [Dedected](https://detected.org/)  on BT5.  I understand they use Audacity to merge all the WAV files generated by Dedected in one single file, but perhaps there are more tools for this purpose.

UPDATE: I have also  found the following video that explains the whole process
