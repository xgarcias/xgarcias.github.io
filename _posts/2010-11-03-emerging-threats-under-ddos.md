As Matthew Jonkman [comments](http://lists.emergingthreats.net/pipermail/emerging-sigs/2010-November/010162.html)   in  the [emerging-sigs](http://lists.emergingthreats.net/mailman/listinfo/emerging-sigs) mailing list,  [Emerging Threats](http://www.emergingthreats.net/) is under a DDoS attack since  November 1st, but the rule distributions is not being affected.  
  

> Still taking a DDoS, but we have a good idea who it is. For the time being do NOT visit emergingthreats.net. http://www.emergingthreats.net is fine, but will be down for a while yet likely. 
>
> Rules are unaffected, make sure you're downloading from rules.emergingthreats.net. 
>
> Thanks for everyone's support. We're doing something right if they're spending time on us. Rally the troops! Keep up the fight!
