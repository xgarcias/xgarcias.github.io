[wXf](https://github.com/WebExploitationFramework/wXf/wiki/) is a new framework focused on web application security and written in Ruby, with the look and feel of [Metasploit](http://www.metasploit.com/).
 
I have read some posts written by [carnalOwnage](http://carnal0wnage.attackresearch.com/)  as well as some [videos on Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/user2590597/videos) and I have to say it  looks really interesting :)

I am quite sure that my definition is too simple, but I understand it follows the same principle of [Metasploit](http://www.metasploit.com/) but oriented to Web Application security, with the advantage of being well integrated with [Burp](http://portswigger.net/burp/). Of course, this tool can be really helpful to pen-testers that do an extensive use of [Burp](http://portswigger.net/burp/), because  it will permit to script many tasks with [Buby modules](https://github.com/WebExploitationFramework/wXf/wiki/Creating-a-Buby-Module)  and automate many attacks, saving lots of time.

Doing some searches on Google I also found this video on [securitytube.net](http://www.securitytube.net/) that corresponds to a talk offered during the [APPSEC DC 2010](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSec_DC_2010).
