This  [post](http://lanmaster53.com/2011/05/7-linux-shells-using-built-in-tools/) by [lanmaster53.com](http://lanmaster53.com/)  explains how to setup reverse shells on Linux  sy stems (and many Unix flavors).  
  
The different solutions range from Netcat (with and without  GAPI NG_SECURITY_HOLE disabled) to crazy combinations of named pipes and telnet connections.
