There has been a lot of  [FUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt) going on in the IDS/IPS market. [Stonesoft](http://www.stonesoft.com/en/) has launched a [campaign](http://www.antievasion.com/) saying that their product is the only able to stop some advanced attacks that are not public.  
  
I am not an expert in the field, but there are two things that worry me:  

* Somebody saying that they can stop all the advanced attacks with "anti evasion techniques", but the are no details or whatsoever.
* All the competitors are not able to achieve the same results.

For me, it looks like a nasty FUD trying to gain some market in the short term, but history has demonstrated that it is a bad strategy.

Anyway, I always trust people that openly discusses the problems, like researchers and open source developers.
