Nice [post](https://blogs.sans.org/computer-forensics/2010/09/27/digital-forensics-security-incident-cycle/)  from the [Sans Computer Forensics Blog](https://blogs.sans.org/computer-forensics/) about the Security Incident Cycle and how organizations struggle to follow the steps.  
  
This post was inspired by [Richard  Bejtlich](http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/)'s presentation in the [Forensics Incident Response Summit 2010](http://www.sans.org/forensics-incident-response-summit-2010/)
