Nice [video](http://blog.tenablesecurity.com/2010/10/integrating-hydra-with-nessus-video.html) from [Paul Asadoorian](http://www.pauldotcom.com/) in the [tenablesecurity blog](http://blog.tenablesecurity.com/) .  
  
The blog post discusses how to integrate Hydra with Nessus  to run brute force attacks against your infrastructure: installing hydra and configuring Nessus.  
  
The post also points to different good resources to get your list of users and passwords that will be used to perform the brute force attack.
