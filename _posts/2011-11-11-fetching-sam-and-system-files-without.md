The linked blog post explains how to fetch the SAM and System files from a Windows computer without shutting down the system.

Since both files are locked by other processes, they cannot be read. Therefore, the standard procedure would be shutting down Windows and running a live distribution to obtain a copy.

The article points to a [talk given by Tim Tomes and Mark Bagget](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/hack3rcon2/tim-tomes-and-mark-baggett-lurking-in-the-shadows) in [Hack3rcon II](http://hack3rcon.org/), where they introduce a script they wrote to extract the filesÂ  by creating [Shadow Copies](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb968832%28v=vs.85%29.aspx).
