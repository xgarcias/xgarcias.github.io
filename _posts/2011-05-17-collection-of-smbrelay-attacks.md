This is a [series of blog posts](http://dsecrg.blogspot.com/search/label/SMBRelay%20bible) from the [Digital Security Research Group](http://dsecrg.blogspot.com/) that collects all the possible ways to gain access by executing SMBRelay attacks or by stealing token credentials.  
  
So far, they have discussed the following scenarios:  
  
* Attacking ERP systems.  
* Attacking MSSQL servers.  
* SMBRelay and Oracle.  
* Security software that scans the clients via SMB  
* Attacking corporate users
