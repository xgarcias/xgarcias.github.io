[Abuse.ch](http://www.abuse.ch/) has created a [Tracker for the Palevo botnet](http://www.abuse.ch/?p=3231) that will provide a blocklist for the well known C&C.  
  
I quote:  

> Palevo (also known as Rimecud, Butterfly bot or Pilleuz) made some big press in 2009 when Panda Security [announced](http://pandalabs.pandasecurity.com/mariposa-botnet/) the coordinated takedown of a huge botnet that they called Mariposa.
>
> Palevo is a so called bot kit that is being sold in underground forums (like [ZeuS](https://zeustracker.abuse.ch/faq.php)) using the name BUtterFly BOT. Therefore there are dozens of different botnets out there run by different criminal groups.
>   
> As outlined above, Palevo is a huge threat for corporate- and home networks. Due to the fact that it is spread widely and most people are not aware of the problem I have decided to create Palevo Tracker. My goals are:  
>   
> *   Get some attention on the Palevo threat
> *   Provide a blocklist for well known Palevo C&Cs to the internet community
> *   Provide details regarding Palevo C&Cs to ISPs, CERTs and Law Enforcement
> *   Keep the project smart and simple as possible
>
> To keep it simple I’ve created Palevo Tracker as sub-project on AMaDa. This means that the Palevo Tracker blocklist is included in the [AMaDa](http://amada.abuse.ch/) C&C Blocklist.
