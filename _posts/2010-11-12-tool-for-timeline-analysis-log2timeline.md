> **log2timeline**, a framework for automatic creation of a super timeline. The main purpose is to provide a single tool to parse various log files and artifacts found on suspect systems (and supporting systems, such as network equipment) and produce a timeline that can be analysed by forensic investigators/analysts.

  
Example of usage: [introduction](https://blogs.sans.org/computer-forensics/2009/08/13/artifact-timeline-creation-and-analysis-tool-release-log2timeline/)  and [solution](https://blogs.sans.org/computer-forensics/2009/08/14/artifact-timeline-creation-and-analysis-part-2/)
