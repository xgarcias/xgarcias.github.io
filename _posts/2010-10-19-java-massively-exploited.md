Yes, not only Adobe is being targeted in Windows platforms even though they are making things easy for the black hats :D  
  
As [Brian Krebs says](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2010/10/microsoft-a-tidal-wave-of-java-exploitation/), Microsoft is [warning](http://blogs.technet.com/b/mmpc/archive/2010/10/18/have-you-checked-the-java.aspx) about attacks against Java, with vulnerabilities that date back to 2008 (I have investigated attacks that used vulnerabilities patched back in 2006 and continue to be very effective)!  
  
* **CVE-2008-5353** - 1,196,480 computers infected.  
* **CVE-2009-3867** - 1,119,191 computers infected  
* **CVE-2010-0094** -   173,123 computers infected.  
  
Microsoft says that it kind of makes sense because Java is widely installed and nobody thinks to update it, like Adobe Acrobat. So, it is a nice candidate to be added to exploit packs and get a nice infection rate ;)
