Some [resources](http://geek00l.blogspot.com/2010/12/sflow-resources.html) to monitor networks with sFlow. Seen in [geek00l's blog.](http://geek00l.blogspot.com/)  
  
[sFlow](http://www.sflow.org/) is a technology comparable to [Netflow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflow) , that can be used to monitor in real time the network activity.
