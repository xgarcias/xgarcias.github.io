I have learnt via this [post](http://blogs.rsa.com/rsafarl/spyeye-botmasters-fight-back-%E2%80%93-targeting-swiss-security-sites-spyeye-tracker/) that cybercriminals are trying to sabotage abuse.ch's trackers.  
  
They have added a ddos plug-in to the trojans that will attack  their infrastructure  and also they are trying to introduce legit domains in the tracker by adding them to to the list of drop points.
