Create and fire up the packet capture
=====================================
```
# capture MYCAP interface IFNAME packet-length 1500 buffer SIZE  
```
  

The above command will capture everything; if you want to filter your capture, add an access list, like so:
```
# capture MYCAP interface IFNAME packet-length 1500 access-list 777 buffer SIZE
```

  
Remember to define access-list 777 first. Of course, you can substitute 777 with any other number.

  
Stop the capture
================
```
# no capture MYCAP interface IFNAME
```

  
Retrieve the captured data
==========================
* Point your browser to the firewall SSL URL like so: https://FW-IP-address/capture/MYCAP/pcap  
* Download the pcap file, and open it with wireshark or a similar tool.  
Note: you can also use tftp to get the pcap.

  
Clean-up
========
```
# no capture MYCAP
```
