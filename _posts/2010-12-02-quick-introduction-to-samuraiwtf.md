[holisticinfosec](http://holisticinfosec.blogspot.com/2010/12/toolsmith-samuraiwtf.html) describes the purpose of [SamuraiWTF](http://samurai.inguardians.com/).  
  
  

> SamuraiWTF is a LiveCD Linux release designed to serve you for your web pen-testing needs. Kevin Johnson of Secure Ideas and Justin Searle of InGuardians included what they believe are the best of the open source and free tools that focus on testing and attacking websites, selections based on the tools they use as part of their job duties. SamuraiWTF includes tools useful in all four steps of a web pen-test:  
> * Reconnaissance – Fierce domain scanner, Maltego (be sure to check out the [Shodan Maltego add-on](http://maltego.shodanhq.com/))  
> * Mapping – WebScarab, ratproxy  
> * Discovery – w3af and burp  
> * Exploitation – BeEF, AJAXShell

  
Russ McRee points to his [article](http://holisticinfosec.org/toolsmith/pdf/december2010.pdf) published in the December 2010 issue of the [ISSA Journal](http://www.issa.org/Members/Journal/). The article gives a quick introduction to the tools available  in  [SamuraiWTF](http://samurai.inguardians.com/).
