Looks like people is working to support Linux memory images in Volatility. You can find more information in the  [volatility blog](http://volatility.tumblr.com/post/3601273213/when-it-comes-to-linux-volatility-does-beta) and the [attrc's blog](http://dfsforensics.blogspot.com/2011/03/bringing-linux-support-to-volatility.html) (developer).  
  
attrc's blog post is specially interesting because explains the currently implemented functionalities.  
  
There is also this nice [blog post](http://dfsforensics.blogspot.com/2011/03/analyzing-new-honeynet-memory-analysis.html) that explains how to use the new Linux support on Volatility  to resolve the last [Honeynet challenge](http://www.honeynet.org/challenges/2011_7_compromised_server).
