Thanks to [Irongeek](http://www.irongeek.com/) I have found the following [talk](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/skydogcon1/nick-levay-counter-espionage-strategy-and-tactics) at [SkyDogCon](http://www.skydogcon.com/).  
  
This is a really good talk you have to watch if you want to understand [APT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat) beyond any [FUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt) and if you wantÂ  learn how to defend your network against it.
