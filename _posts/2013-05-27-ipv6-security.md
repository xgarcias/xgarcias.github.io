This is a short [video](http://data.proidea.org.pl/confidence/7edycja/materialy/video/Piotr%20Wojciechowski.mpg) that discusses the security problems in IPv6, mainly DoS and MITM similar to the ones existing in IPv4. Unfortunately, the speaker doesn't introduce any tool for testing/pentesting our networks.

The talk discusses the problems found in the protocol and also exposes some extensions implemented in Cisco devices that may help to reduce the impact, even though they are not widely implemented in all platforms.

The original [source](http://www.secdocs.org/docs/ipv6-security-audio/) is [SecDocs](http://www.secdocs.org/).
