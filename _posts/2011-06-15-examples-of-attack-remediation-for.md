I have found this [post](http://blog.c22.cc/2011/06/13/first2011-remediating-compromised-environments/) that seems to be the resume of a talk  given by an employee of [Mandiant](http://www.mandiant.com/) at [FIRST 2011](http://conference.first.org/).

The text explains the steps that need to be taken to remediate  the attack and the possible scenarios that a small and a large enterprise can face. It is not meant to be a cheat-sheet but  rather the experience in the field and tactics that helped them to be successful.
