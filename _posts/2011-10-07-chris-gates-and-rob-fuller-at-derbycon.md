Really nice presentation that [Chris Gates](http://carnal0wnage.attackresearch.com/) and [Rob Fuller](http://www.room362.com/) gave at [Derbycon](http://www.derbycon.com/) 2011  (via [IronGeek](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/derbycon1/mainlist)).

In a nutshell,  the talk exposes how a pen-test should be carried instead of  the simple 'scan-exploit-report'.
 
A proper penetration test must be data driven and it will always be costumer dependent. In fact, one of the most complicated parts of a penetration test is deciding with the costumer the objective and the rules of engagement.

The last part explains several post-exploitation techniques and some available tools that are under development.
