I quote:  

> [WirelessKeyDump](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/wireless_key_dump.html) is a console application (Command Prompt) that dumps the list of all wireless keys stored by the wireless networks module of Windows operating system.
>   
>  This utility works on any version of Windows starting from Windows 2000 and up to Windows 7/2008. On Windows 7/Vista/2008, you must use it from a command-prompt window that was started with 'Run As Administrator'. On x64 systems, you must download and use the x64 version of this tool.
