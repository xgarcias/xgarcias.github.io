This video has been created by [IronGeek](http://www.irongeek.com/) and it is originally [available](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/basic-setup-of-security-onion-snort-snorby-barnyard-pulledpork-daemonlogger) on his website.

I wanted to post it on the blog because setting up a Network Security Monitoring system with [Security-Onion](http://securityonion.blogspot.com/) is rather easy compared with the days I had to deploy Sguil by hand. Doug Burks is doing a great job here:)

I have to say that I prefer using [Sguil](http://sguil.sourceforge.net/) in a [NSM](http://nsmwiki.org/Main_Page) system as [Richard Bejtlich](http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/) has [explained many times](http://www.taosecurity.com/books.html), but [Snorby](http://snorby.org/) may be useful for many people.

Here you can find Richard Bejtlich talking about NSM and Sguil.
