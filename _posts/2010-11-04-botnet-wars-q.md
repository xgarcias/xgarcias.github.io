Interesting [article](http://malwaredatabase.net/blog/index.php/2010/10/25/the-botnet-wars-a-qa/) that describes how botnets and the underground market work.  

> In todayâ€™s article (which will be a Q&A, a question & answer), I hope to be able to clear up the mystery behind these kits. I have been able to interview experts in the anti-malware world. They will each give their opinion on this particular subject.
