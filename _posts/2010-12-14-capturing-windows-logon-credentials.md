Great [blog post](http://blog.metasploit.com/2010/12/capturing-windows-logons-with.html) from the [Metasploit blog](http://blog.metasploit.com/) that explains how to use a keylogger to capture the Windows Logon credentials.  
  
Smartlocker is a script meant to capture the Windows credentials used to unlock the session.  
  
Behavior:  
- Migrates to winlogon.exe  
- Waits for the session to be locked (the session is idle).  
- Starts the keylogger until the session is unlocked (by typing the username and the password)  
- Stops the keylogger  
- The credentials are stored in a text file located inÂ **/home/{user}/.msf3/logs/scripts/smartlocker/**
