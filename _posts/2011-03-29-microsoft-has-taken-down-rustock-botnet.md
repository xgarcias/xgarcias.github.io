Probably many people is already aware, because this information has created many headlines and hit the media.  
  
Yes, Microsoft has reportedly taken down the [Rustock botnet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rustock_botnet), like they did before with [Waledac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waledac_botnet).  
  
I tend to think It was a coordinated effort with many researchers and institutions involved, but we cannot deny that Microsoft has the needed resources to make it possible :)  
  
This is a small compilation of articles/post I have found on Internet:
