[contest.korelogic.com](http://contest.korelogic.com/wordlists.html) has good compilation of wordlists that were used in the Defcon 2010 password cracking contest.  
  
  

> The following are wordlists both used to create the 2010 contest, but also used to crack passwords found "in the wild". Download these, use 'gunzip' to decompress them, and use them with your favorite password cracking tool  
> Note: Most of the words are in ALL lower case, you will need to use "rules" in order to capitalize certain characters. Use [the following rules](http://contest.korelogic.com/rules.html) combined with these wordlists/dictionaries in order to crack passwords
