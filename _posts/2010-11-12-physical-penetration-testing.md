# _Resume_

Purpose and goals of the pentest (the customer may not know or be wrong)
========================================================================
* What is running your business?  
  
Why?
====
* attack vectors  
* evaluate the controls  
* potential vulnerabilities  
* find real threats to the organization  
* It must be a repeatable process and easy to explain  
 (the methodology is important)  
* perhaps a security review can be done instead of a pentest  
 (A pentest in a really insecure place is not worthy)  
  
  
Scope  
=====
* which targets how can you attack and how?  
* what are you authorized to do versus real world?  
  
Methodologies  
=============
* Open Source Security Testing Methodology  
* ISECOM  
* Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design  
  
Threat Source Analysis  
======================
* actors  
* Funding, motivation and time  
  
Method  
======
* research  
* reconnaissance (google maps :D )  
* planning  
* execution  
* extraction  
* Wrap Up  
  
Real world examples
