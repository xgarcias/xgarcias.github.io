[Irongeek](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/derbycon1/mainlist) has started publishing the Videos of [Derbycon 2011](http://www.derbycon.com/) and the following one is probably one of my favorites so far.  
  
Kevin Mitnick and Dave Kennedy go through some examples of penetration tests that, mainly, use social engineering attacks.  
  
At the end of the talk Dave Kennedy also presented the new version of [The Social-Enginner Toolkit](http://www.secmaniac.com/october-2011/the-social-engineer-toolkit-set-v2-1-rebirth-has-been-released/).  
  
Really worth watching!
