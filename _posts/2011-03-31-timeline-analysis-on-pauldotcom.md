Awesome [tech segment](http://pauldotcom.com/wiki/index.php/Episode236) on  MFT Timeline analysis from the Pauldotcom guys.  
  
The Tech Segment explains how to perform a Timeline analysis  with open-source tools and how to spot anti-forensics techniques like timestamp manipulations.  
  
More information on timestamp manipulation can be found in the [Sans Computer Forensics Blog](http://computer-forensics.sans.org/blog/2010/11/02/digital-forensics-time-stamp-manipulation/) that I already commented in this [post](http://www.shellguardians.com/2010/11/detecting-time-stamp-manipulation-in.html).  
  
The original blog post on the [Sans Computer Forensics Blog](http://computer-forensics.sans.org/blog/2010/11/02/digital-forensics-time-stamp-manipulation/) talks about a tool called  [mft_parser_cl](http://redwolfcomputerforensics.com/downloads/MFT_Parser_05b_Setup.exe)created by  **_Mark McKinnon_** that has been released for this tech segment. It is really helpful to spot timestamp manipulations, because it is able to pull $FILE_NAME time stamps and put them into bodyfile format so they can be added to the overall time line for analysis.
